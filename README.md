# Arduino Uno PIR Motion Sensor

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a Passive Infrared (PIR) motion sensor with an Arduino Uno to detect motion in its surroundings. The Arduino reads the sensor's output and prints motion detection status to the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno**
- **PIR Motion Sensor**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect PIR Motion Sensor to Arduino Uno:**
   - Connect the output pin of the PIR motion sensor to digital pin 2 on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the VCC pin of the sensor to 5V on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the GND pin of the sensor to GND on the Arduino Uno.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire up the PIR motion sensor to the Arduino Uno according to the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Observe the output on the Serial Monitor, which will indicate "Motion detected!" when motion is detected by the PIR sensor.

#### Applications

- **Security Systems:** Use in home security systems to detect intrusions or movement in restricted areas.
- **Automation:** Implement in automated lighting systems for energy-efficient operation based on occupancy.
- **Interactive Installations:** Integrate into interactive projects where motion triggers specific responses or actions.

#### Notes

- Ensure the PIR sensor is mounted in a location where it can effectively detect motion without obstruction.
- Adjust sensitivity and time settings on the PIR sensor module if supported, to fine-tune detection parameters.
- Consider power management strategies to optimize battery life if using the sensor in portable or battery-operated projects.
